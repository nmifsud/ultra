Sleep deprivation is a limiting factor in non-stop ultrarunning races. Those who push the boundaries contend with cognitive and perceptual distortions. In this program, a series of mixed Markov models accentuates the unique conditions associated with extreme acts of endurance. Each generated text is rooted in [actual reports](http://barkleymarathons.com/) by winners of the idiosyncratic [Barkley Marathons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barkley_Marathons)—and as it unfolds, another influence emerges: a selection of psychoactive experiences published on [Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/).

Opening sample:

> I never stopped to dig some food out of camp as quickly as possible. A tight IT band, along with some hip alignment issues from months prior, resulted in violent fit of retching and vomiting all over ourselves like Rocky Balboa and Apollo Creed in that area constantly diverging, merging, and spontaneously ending. David could have created a problem though if I had to make decent decisions. Okay, I wasn’t laughing… it was now going to either mis-navigate or hit an extremely vibrant orange and red cardinal just sitting atop a leafless gray tree.

Closing samples:

> I thought no way in too, that a large group following closely behind. My soul was glowing green, blue and green needles mesh into one of my physical space began to flash back to my body. Physically I feel as if drawn by strange attractors all over the cliff's edge and sat to eat.

> I could see every molecule and atom in all directions while simultaneously delving inward. I don't actually know if that deep whooshing OHHMMMM I felt awkward for my chance at finishing the 100. Each time, I didn't need to keep using the walking sticks to transfer some weight from my hips through my body like rainbow fur.
